# game_of_life
Representation of Conway's game of life

Assumptions:
- grid is a n x n rectangle (ideally infinite but for visual purposes made fixed size)
- Initial grid will be all dead cells unless initialised with a seed grid
- Grid is a toroidal array
- Only basic scenarios need to be proven so no animation added, only snapshot timestep view available
